## Gameplay

A player chooses a character from a list on 9 characters to battle the remaining 8. The player will then battle an opponent until either the player's health or the opponent's health has reached zero. The player has the option to choose a kick attack, a punch attack, or a special attack which is unique to each character to try and reduce the level of the opponents health. Once the player has taken a turn, the computer opponent will attack the player with a random attack of its own. Both the player and computer opponent have a level of defense against the attacks. Characters have different levels of attacks and defense that are shown at the selection screen between low, medium, and high. If the player survives the battle with the first opponent they will move on to the next round.
